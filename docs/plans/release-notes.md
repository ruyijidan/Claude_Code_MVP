# Release Notes / 发布说明

## 2026-04-16

### GLM5 Provider And Web Game Demo / GLM5 Provider 与网页小游戏 Demo

Included commits:

- `5320aec` `feat: support explicit auth source selection`
- `a4edc0d` `feat: add glm5 provider and web game demo`

Highlights:

- added a dedicated `glm5` provider backed by an Anthropic-compatible messages API adapter
- added proxy-bypass handling for private gateway targets such as `llm-api.zego.cloud`
- confirmed live delegated execution through `glm5` with a real `MODEL_OK` response
- added a zero-dependency browser game demo under [`examples/web-game`](../../examples/web-game)
- kept the existing `claude_code` and `codex_cli` paths separate from the new compatible API path

Verification:

- unit test suite passed: `61 tests OK`
- live `glm5` delegated provider check passed
- local static serving check for the web game returned `HTTP 200`

Impact:

- the harness can now execute coding-style delegated prompts through a configured `GLM-5` compatible endpoint
- the repository now includes a simple end-user-facing web artifact that can be opened directly in a browser or shared on a LAN
